# Fuel-consumption

The dataset we are going to work with contains transactions about a REAL company that manages 82 gas stations located in Italy for the years 2018 and 2019.

It's crucial for the sales department to quantify how much fuel needs to be reloaded into a single gas station.

In a real scenario there are multiple factors that might affects the fuel consuption, in this projects we are going to explore them in order to find a Regressor that can handle this problem.

NOTE: in the fuelconsumption.ipynb file you will find the complete project.
